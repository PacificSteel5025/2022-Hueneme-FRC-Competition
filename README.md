# 2022-Hueneme-FRC-Competition
cool and epic
This code was made for the 2022 Frc robotics competition. 
Autonomous: the autonomous only consists of the robot backing up and nothing else. The robot backs up for roughly 5 seconds. 
TeleOp: The code was made for 4 motors, a camera that can rotate both vertically and horizontally, and an elevator that is meant to pick up and empty balls into a hoop.
